# Parking yolo

In this repo, we will use a park detection dataset.
Here, we will go over some of the important points and the changes that we have made.

The dataset has been downloaded from roboflow [here.](https://universe.roboflow.com/rawdatasetmaison/data_out_raw/dataset/1 "Click here")



## Google Colab File Link (A Single Click Solution)

The google colab file link for yolov7 parking detection is provided below, 
you can check the implementation in Google Colab, and its a single click implementation, 
you just need to select the Run Time as GPU, and click on Run All. It is recommended not to train the model.

## Park model with weather augmented image and 100 epochs.

Our team has trained a model with 100 epochs and this is the results. You can [download](https://drive.google.com/u/3/uc?id=1DocweSxBheINGL_yJ1kndiSvLXJFESOU&export=download "Click here")

Also the confusion matrix has been plotted.

We thought that weather augmented images would be interested. Here, we have some examples.
